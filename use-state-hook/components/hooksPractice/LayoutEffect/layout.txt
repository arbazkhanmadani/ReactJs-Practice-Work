use Layout Effect Hook
--------------------------------------

1.Works similar to useEffect, but instead gets called before view gets mounted.

Difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect:

1.useEffect gets called when the view appears or mounted. [At the time of moumting]
2.useLayoutEffect gets called before the view appears or mounted. [After the mounting]

his can be useful when needing to show list of items instantly upon screen display,
without it causing a small blink/flash.


Warning: React official docs say: “useLayoutEffect can hurt performance. Prefer useEffect when possible.”
