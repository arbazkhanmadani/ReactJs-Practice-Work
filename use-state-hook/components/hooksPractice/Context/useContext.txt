Use Contexthook
-------------------------------------



1.UseContext is a way to manage state globally.
  It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between
  deeply nested[From GrandPa to Grand Child] components more easily than with useState alone.

2. Overcome Prop Drilling.

-----------------------------------------------------


The Problem
State should be held by the highest parent component in the stack that requires access to the state.
To illustrate, we have many nested components. 
The component at the top and bottom of the stack need access to the state.
To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as "props" through each nested component.
This is called "prop drilling".
