React useCallback Hoo
--------------------------


1.The React useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.
2.Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
3.This allows us to isolate resource intensive functions so that 
  they will not automatically run on every render.
4.The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
5.This can improve performance.
